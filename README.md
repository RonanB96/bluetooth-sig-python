# BLE GATT Device Framework

A comprehensive registry-driven BLE GATT framework with real device integration and Home Assistant compatibility. This project provides a robust, extensible architecture for BLE device communication with automatic UUID resolution, data parsing, and clean separation between Bluetooth and application layers.

## Features

- **Registry-Driven Architecture**: YAML-based UUID registry with automatic class name resolution
- **Real Device Integration**: Bleak-based BLE connection with optimized timeouts (10s for reliability)
- **Data Parsing Framework**: Convert raw BLE data to meaningful sensor values with units
- **Home Assistant Ready**: Clean separation between GATT and HA integration layers
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 80+ validation tests covering all services and characteristics
- **Type-Safe Implementation**: Complete type hints and dataclass-based design

## Supported GATT Services

  - Battery Level (0x2A19)
  
- **Device Information Service (0x180A)**
  - Manufacturer Name String (0x2A29)
  - Model Number String (0x2A24)
  - Serial Number String (0x2A25)

### Registry Coverage

- **13 Characteristics** fully implemented with validation
- **Complete Bluetooth SIG compliance** via official UUID registry
- **Automatic name resolution** with multiple format attempts

## Architecture

### Four-Layer Design

1. **UUID Registry** (`src/ble_gatt_device/gatt/uuid_registry.py`): Loads Bluetooth SIG official UUIDs from YAML files
2. **Base Classes** (`src/ble_gatt_device/gatt/{services,characteristics}/base.py`): Automatic UUID resolution via class name parsing
3. **Implementations**: Concrete services/characteristics with data parsing capabilities
4. **Real Device Integration** (`src/ble_gatt_device/core.py`): Bleak-based BLE connection and data parsing

### Key Architectural Principles

- **Name-Based UUID Resolution**: `BatteryService` ‚Üí "Battery" ‚Üí UUID "180F"
- **Clean Layer Separation**: GATT ‚Üê Translation ‚Üê Home Assistant (never reverse)
- **Data Parsing**: Raw bytes ‚Üí meaningful values with units
- **Connection Optimization**: 10-second timeout for reliable device connections
- **Type Safety**: Complete type hints throughout the framework

### Testing Framework

- **80+ Comprehensive Tests**: Full validation of services, characteristics, and registry
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Automatic detection of all service and characteristic classes  
- **Real Device Testing**: Scripts for testing with actual BLE hardware (Nordic Thingy:52 validated)
- **Registry Validation**: Ensures all implementations match Bluetooth SIG standards
- **Architecture Separation**: Validates clean layer boundaries between GATT and HA

## Real Device Integration

### Supported Devices

- **Nordic Thingy:52**: Environmental sensor with battery, temperature, humidity, pressure
- **Connection Requirements**: 10-second timeout for reliable service discovery
- **Services Tested**: Battery (180F), Environmental Sensing (181A), Device Information (180A)

## Usage Examples

### Real Device Connection

```python
from ble_gatt_device.core import BLEGATTDevice
import asyncio

async def read_device_data():
    device = BLEGATTDevice("AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF")
    
    # Read raw characteristics data
    raw_data = await device.read_characteristics()
    print(f"Raw data: {raw_data}")
    
    # Read parsed data with units
    parsed_data = await device.read_parsed_characteristics()
    print(f"Parsed data: {parsed_data}")

asyncio.run(read_device_data())
```

### Basic Service Usage

```python
from ble_gatt_device.gatt.services.battery_service import BatteryService
from ble_gatt_device.gatt.characteristics.battery_level import BatteryLevelCharacteristic

# Create service instance
battery_service = BatteryService()
print(f"Service UUID: {battery_service.SERVICE_UUID}")  # 180F

# Get expected characteristics
characteristics = battery_service.get_expected_characteristics()
print(characteristics)  # {'Battery Level': BatteryLevelCharacteristic}

# Parse characteristic data
char = BatteryLevelCharacteristic()
value = char.parse_value(bytearray([85]))  # 85% battery
print(f"Battery level: {value}{char.unit}")  # Battery level: 85%
```

### UUID Registry Usage

```python
from ble_gatt_device.gatt.uuid_registry import uuid_registry

# Look up service by name
service_info = uuid_registry.get_service_info("Battery")
print(f"UUID: {service_info.uuid}, ID: {service_info.id}")

# Look up characteristic by UUID
char_info = uuid_registry.get_characteristic_info("2A19")
print(f"Name: {char_info.name}, Properties: {char_info.properties}")
```
