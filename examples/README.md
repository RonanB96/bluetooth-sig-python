# Bluetooth SIG Integration Examples

This directory contains comprehensive examples demonstrating how to use the `bluetooth_sig` library with different BLE connection libraries. The examples showcase the **framework-agnostic design** where bluetooth_sig provides pure SIG standards parsing while you choose your preferred BLE library for connections.

## üéØ Key Concept: Framework-Agnostic Design

The `bluetooth_sig` library separates **connection management** from **data parsing**:

```python
# Step 1: Get raw data (using ANY BLE library)
raw_data = await your_ble_library.read_characteristic(device, uuid)

# Step 2: Parse with bluetooth_sig (connection-agnostic)
from bluetooth_sig import BluetoothSIGTranslator
translator = BluetoothSIGTranslator()
result = translator.parse_characteristic(uuid, raw_data)

# Step 3: Use parsed result
print(f"Value: {result.value} {result.unit}")
```

This pattern works with **any BLE library** - you're not locked into a specific connection framework.

## üîó BLE Library Compatibility

| Library | Platform | Async | Installation | Status |
|---------|----------|-------|--------------|--------|
| **bleak** | Cross-platform | ‚úÖ | `pip install bleak` | ‚úÖ Recommended |
| **bleak-retry-connector** | Cross-platform | ‚úÖ | `pip install bleak-retry-connector` | üèÜ **Best for Production** |
| **SimpleBLE** | Cross-platform | ‚ùå | `pip install simpleble` | ‚úÖ Alternative |
| **SimpleBluez** | Linux only | ‚ùå | `pip install simplebluez` | ‚úÖ Linux Alternative |
| **pygatt** | Cross-platform | ‚ùå | `pip install pygatt` | ‚úÖ Compatible* |
| **bluepy** | Linux only | ‚ùå | `pip install bluepy` | ‚úÖ Compatible* |

*Compatible means the same integration pattern works, though not demonstrated in these examples.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Choose your BLE library** based on your platform and requirements
2. **Install bluetooth_sig and your chosen BLE library**:
   ```bash
   pip install bluetooth-sig
   pip install bleak-retry-connector  # Recommended
   ```

### üì¶ Installing All Example Dependencies

To install bluetooth_sig with all BLE libraries used in the examples:

```bash
# Install with all example dependencies (recommended for trying all examples)
pip install bluetooth-sig[examples]

# Or install individually based on your needs:
pip install bluetooth-sig bleak                    # Basic async BLE
pip install bluetooth-sig bleak-retry-connector    # Production-ready with retry logic  
pip install bluetooth-sig simplebluez              # Linux alternative
```

**Note:** Some libraries like `simpleble` may not be available on all platforms. The `[examples]` installation will skip unavailable packages gracefully.
3. **Start with an example** that matches your chosen library
4. **Adapt the pattern** to your specific use case

## üéì Integration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Pure SIG Translation (Core)
```python
from bluetooth_sig import BluetoothSIGTranslator

translator = BluetoothSIGTranslator()
result = translator.parse_characteristic(uuid, raw_data)
```

### Pattern 2: With Connection Library
```python
# Connection: Your choice of BLE library
raw_data = await ble_library.read_characteristic(uuid)

# Parsing: Always bluetooth_sig
result = translator.parse_characteristic(uuid, raw_data)
```

### Pattern 3: Robust Production Usage
```python
from bleak_retry_connector import establish_connection
from bluetooth_sig import BluetoothSIGTranslator

translator = BluetoothSIGTranslator()

async with establish_connection(BleakClient, address) as client:
    raw_data = await client.read_gatt_char(uuid)
    result = translator.parse_characteristic(uuid, raw_data)
```

### Pattern 4: Testing Without Hardware
```python
# Mock or file data
test_data = bytes([0x64])  # 100% battery level

# Same parsing code
result = translator.parse_characteristic("2A19", test_data)
assert result.value == 100
```
