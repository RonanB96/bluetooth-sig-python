. Conversation Overview

Objectives: Initial request to clean/remove bleak_retry_integration.py (inspect, modernize/delete, fix errors, update callers). Expanded to eliminate legacy result shapes, remove in-file connection managers, resolve type-check errors, and run linters/tests under "NO LEGACY CODE" mandate. User requested documentation of current/next steps for AI agent continuation.
Session Context: Evolved from targeted file cleanup to broad modernization via searches, reads, patches, error checks, and progress tracking.
User Intent: Specific file cleanup â†’ comprehensive legacy elimination in examples package, emphasizing strict rules (no deprecations, mandatory tests/gates) and AI handoff docs.
2. Technical Foundation

Python 3.9+: Strict typing in production, lenient for examples; Bluetooth SIG parsing and integrations.
Bluetooth SIG Library: Pure standards lib (v0.3.0, msgspec for data structures).
Optional BLE Backends: Bleak/Bleak-retry-connector/SimplePyBLE; runtime imports to avoid failures.
Quality Tools: Ruff (lint/format), Pylint (analysis), MyPy (types), Pytest (tests); strict config in pyproject.toml.
Architecture: Connection managers in connection_managers; runtime imports via importlib; canonical shapes (ReadResult/CharacteristicData) vs. legacy tuples/dicts.
Environment: Linux/bash; src/ layout; quality gates require all tools to pass.
3. Codebase Status

bleak_retry_integration.py: Deleted (syntax errors, redundancy); helpers moved to bleak_utils.py.
bleak_utils.py: New file with runtime-import helpers (e.g., scan_with_bleak_retry).
models.py: parsed field changed to Any for type flexibility.
with_bleak_retry.py: Updated imports; fixed indentation.
test_examples.py: Updated module refs for tests.
4. Problem Resolution

Issues: Syntax errors, "Type unknown" diagnostics, broad exceptions, legacy returns, import failures.
Solutions: Deleted broken file; moved helpers with runtime imports; updated models/types; fixed imports/callers; added __init__.py.
Debugging: Ongoing lint errors (e.g., broad catches, type unknowns); need to narrow exceptions, use TYPE_CHECKING, eliminate legacy shapes.
Lessons: Runtime imports prevent failures; TYPE_CHECKING aids checkers; canonical shapes reduce maintenance.
5. Progress Tracking

Completed: Removed bleak_retry_integration.py; migrated helpers; updated imports; added bleak_utils.py; modified models.py; fixed tests.
Partial: Eliminating legacy shapes (in-progress).
Validated: Formatting passed; linting shows errors; basic_usage.py ran but exited 1 (likely missing deps/errors).
6. Active Work State

Focus: Documenting state/steps for AI continuation per quality gates.
Recent: Patches applied; error checks run; todo updated.
Working Code: Edits to bleak_utils.py, models.py, imports in examples.
Immediate: Addressing user request for AI agent steps.
7. Recent Operations

Last Command: manage_todo_list (write) to update todo with completed bleak cleanup and in-progress legacy shapes.
Results: "Successfully wrote todo list" (with multi-update warning).
Pre-Summary: Documenting steps after patches/error checks.
Context: Tracking progress for "NO LEGACY CODE" mandate and quality gates.
8. Continuation Plan

[Pending 1]: Eliminate legacy shapes - Search examples/* for tuple/dict returns; convert to ReadResult/CharacteristicData; add tests (success + 2 failures).
[Pending 2]: Remove in-file managers - Ensure no ConnectionManager in utils/; all in connection_managers/.
Priorities: Legacy shapes (high, blocks errors); then managers; type errors/gates sequential.
Next Action: Search for legacy returns; plan minimal edits/tests.
