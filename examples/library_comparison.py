"""Library comparison example - compare different BLE libraries with SIG parsing.

This example demonstrates the framework-agnostic nature of bluetooth_sig by
showing how the same SIG parsing code works identically across different BLE
connection libraries. The parsing logic remains unchanged regardless of the
underlying BLE implementation.

Key Demonstration:
- Same bluetooth_sig code works with multiple BLE libraries
- Connection method varies, but SIG parsing is identical
- Framework-agnostic design allows easy migration between libraries
- Performance and feature comparison across libraries

Usage:
    python library_comparison.py --address 12:34:56:78:9A:BC
    python library_comparison.py --scan --compare-all
