# Tutorials

Learn the Bluetooth SIG Standards Library through hands-on, step-by-step lessons. These tutorials will take you from installation to parsing your first BLE characteristics.

:::{tip}
**New to the library?** Start with [Installation](installation.md), then proceed to the [Quick Start](quickstart.md) tutorial to parse your first characteristic in under 5 minutes.
:::

## Learning Path

Follow these tutorials in order for the best learning experience:

### 1. [Installation](installation.md)

Set up the library in your Python environment. Covers pip installation, installation from source, and system prerequisites.

### 2. [Quick Start](quickstart.md) ⭐

Your first 5 minutes with the library. Learn to:

- Import and initialize the translator
- Look up Bluetooth SIG standards by name (no UUIDs to memorize!)
- Parse characteristic data automatically
- Work with simulated data (no BLE hardware required)

**Time:** 5-10 minutes | **Prerequisites:** Python 3.9+ installed

## What You'll Learn

Through these tutorials, you will:

- ✅ Install and configure the library
- ✅ Understand the core `BluetoothSIGTranslator` API
- ✅ Parse standard BLE characteristics without knowing UUIDs
- ✅ Work with typed, validated data structures
- ✅ Test BLE parsing without hardware

## Next Steps

After completing the tutorials, explore:

- **[How-to Guides](../how-to/index.md)** - Solve specific problems and integrate with BLE libraries
- **[API Reference](../api/index.rst)** - Detailed API documentation
- **[Architecture](../explanation/architecture/overview.md)** - Understand how the library works

## Philosophy

These tutorials follow the **learning-oriented** Diataxis principle:

- 🎯 **Hands-on** - You'll write code and see results immediately
- 📚 **Learning by doing** - Practical examples with real (simulated) data
- 🚀 **Achievable goals** - Complete each tutorial successfully
- 🎓 **Build confidence** - Gain practical experience step-by-step
