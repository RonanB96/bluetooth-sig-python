# Understanding the Library

Deep dives into concepts, architecture, and design decisions behind the Bluetooth SIG Standards Library.

## Core Concepts

- **[Why Use This Library](why-use.md)** - Problems this library solves
- **[Choosing the Right API](api-overview.md)** - Which parsing approach to use and when
- **[What It Solves](what-it-solves.md)** - Standards interpretation, UUID management, and type safety
- **[Limitations](limitations.md)** - What this library does NOT do

## Architecture

- **[Overview](architecture/overview.md)** - High-level system design
- **[Design Decisions](architecture/decisions.md)** - Key architectural choices and trade-offs
- **[C4 Model](architecture/c4-model.md)** - Architecture diagrams (Context, Container, Component)
- **[Internals](architecture/internals.md)** - Deep dive into implementation
- **[Registry System](architecture/registry-system.md)** - UUID registry architecture
