# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at <https://github.com/ronanb96/bluetooth-sig-python/issues>.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

Bluetooth SIG Python could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at <https://github.com/ronanb96/bluetooth-sig-python/issues>.

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are welcome :)

## Get Started

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `bluetooth_sig_python` for local development.

1. Fork the `bluetooth_sig_python` repo on GitHub.

1. Clone your fork locally:

   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/bluetooth-sig-python.git
   ```

1. Install your local copy into a virtualenv:

   ```sh
   cd bluetooth-sig-python/
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

1. Create a branch for local development:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

1. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the quality checks and tests:

   ```sh
   ./scripts/format.sh --fix    # Fix formatting
   ./scripts/lint.sh --all      # Run all linting
   python -m pytest tests/     # Run tests
   ```

1. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
   git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

1. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
1. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to the list in README.md.
1. The pull request should work for Python 3.9+. Tests run in GitHub Actions on every pull request to the main branch, make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

## Tips

To run a subset of tests:

```sh
python -m pytest tests/test_specific_module.py
```

## Deploying

### Automated Releases

Releases are automated via GitHub Actions. To create a new release:

1. **Run the release preparation script**:
   ```sh
   ./scripts/prepare-release.sh 0.1.0
   ```
2. **Create and push the version tag**:
   ```sh
   git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Release v0.1.0"
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
- 🏗️  Build the package
- 📦 Publish to Test PyPI, then PyPI (via trusted publishing)
- 📝 Create GitHub release with changelog (via git-cliff)

### Manual Releases

If the release workflow fails, you can manually build and upload:

```sh
python -m build
twine upload dist/*
```

Release notes are auto-generated by git-cliff from conventional commit history.
