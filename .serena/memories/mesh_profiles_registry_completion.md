## Mesh Profiles Registry Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

### Summary
Successfully implemented the Mesh Profiles Registry following the established pattern:
- Created `MeshProfileInfo` dataclass with uuid, name, and id fields
- Implemented `MeshProfilesRegistry` class inheriting from `BaseRegistry[MeshProfileInfo]`
- Added comprehensive lookup methods: by UUID, name, and ID
- Integrated with Bluetooth SIG YAML loading infrastructure
- Created comprehensive test suite with 10 test cases covering success/failure scenarios
- All quality gates pass (ruff, pylint, mypy, shellcheck, pydocstyle)
- Full test suite passes (1064 passed, 6 skipped)

### Key Features
- Thread-safe singleton pattern via BaseRegistry
- Multiple lookup methods for flexibility
- Case-insensitive name lookups
- UUID validation and conversion
- Comprehensive error handling for malformed YAML entries
- Integration with existing registry exports

### Files Modified
- `src/bluetooth_sig/registry/base.py` - Added BaseRegistry class
- `src/bluetooth_sig/registry/mesh_profiles.py` - Complete implementation
- `src/bluetooth_sig/registry/service_classes.py` - Refactored to use BaseRegistry
- `src/bluetooth_sig/registry/__init__.py` - Added BaseRegistry export
- `tests/test_mesh_profiles_registry.py` - Comprehensive test suite

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ All tests pass (10/10 for mesh profiles, 1064/1064 overall)
- ✅ All linting checks pass
- ✅ Type safety verified
- ✅ No code duplication (eliminated via BaseRegistry)
- ✅ Follows established patterns and conventions
