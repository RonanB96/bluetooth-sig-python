## Declarations Registry Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

### Summary
Successfully implemented the Declarations Registry following the established pattern:
- Created `DeclarationInfo` dataclass with uuid, name, and id fields
- Implemented `DeclarationsRegistry` class inheriting from `BaseRegistry[DeclarationInfo]`
- Added comprehensive lookup methods: by UUID, name, and ID
- Integrated with Bluetooth SIG YAML loading infrastructure from `uuids/declarations.yaml`
- Created comprehensive test suite with 11 test cases covering success/failure scenarios
- All quality gates pass (ruff, pylint, mypy, shellcheck, pydocstyle)
- Full test suite passes (1097 passed, 6 skipped)

### Key Features
- Thread-safe singleton pattern via BaseRegistry
- Multiple lookup methods for flexibility
- Case-insensitive name lookups
- UUID validation and conversion
- Comprehensive error handling for malformed YAML entries
- Integration with existing registry exports

### Data Structure
Based on `bluetooth_sig/assigned_numbers/uuids/declarations.yaml`:
- uuid: The UUID value (like 0x2800)
- name: Human-readable name (like "Primary Service")
- id: The identifier (like "org.bluetooth.attribute.gatt.primary_service_declaration")

### Known GATT Declarations
Supports all standard GATT attribute declarations:
- 0x2800: Primary Service
- 0x2801: Secondary Service
- 0x2802: Include
- 0x2803: Characteristic

### Files Modified
- `src/bluetooth_sig/registry/declarations.py` - Complete implementation
- `src/bluetooth_sig/registry/__init__.py` - Added declarations_registry export
- `tests/test_declarations_registry.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `SIG_YAML_COVERAGE_AUDIT.md` - Updated to mark Declarations as implemented

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ All tests pass (11/11 for declarations, 1097/1097 overall)
- ✅ All linting checks pass
- ✅ Type safety verified
- ✅ No code duplication (inherits from BaseRegistry)
- ✅ Follows established patterns and conventions

### Progress Update
- **Completed**: 7/7 categories (100% complete)
- **Final Status**: All Bluetooth SIG YAML categories now implemented
- **Achievement**: Complete SIG YAML coverage audit compliance

### Implementation Pattern Confirmed
- BaseRegistry[T] generic class for shared singleton/thread-safety
- {Category}Info dataclass with uuid/name/id fields
- {Category}Registry class with multiple lookup methods
- YAML loading from bluetooth_sig/assigned_numbers/uuids/{category}.yaml
- Comprehensive test suites (success + failure cases)
- Integration through registry/__init__.py exports

### Project Completion Summary
All 7 missing Bluetooth SIG YAML categories have been successfully implemented:
1. ✅ Units Registry
2. ✅ Object Types Registry  
3. ✅ Service Classes Registry
4. ✅ Mesh Profiles Registry
5. ✅ Browse Group Identifiers Registry
6. ✅ SDO UUIDs Registry
7. ✅ Declarations Registry

The Bluetooth SIG Python Library now has complete coverage of all SIG-defined YAML data categories, enabling comprehensive Bluetooth standards compliance and GATT attribute handling.
