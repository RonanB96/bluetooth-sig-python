## SDO UUIDs Registry Implementation - COMPLETED ✅

### Summary
Successfully implemented the SDO UUIDs Registry following the established pattern:
- Created `SdoInfo` dataclass with uuid, name, and synthetic id fields
- Implemented `SdoUuidsRegistry` class inheriting from `BaseRegistry[SdoInfo]`
- Added comprehensive lookup methods: by UUID, name, and ID
- Integrated with Bluetooth SIG YAML loading infrastructure from `uuids/sdo_uuids.yaml`
- Implemented synthetic ID generation for entries missing 'id' field using "org.bluetooth.sdo.{normalized_name}"
- Created comprehensive test suite with 12 test cases covering success/failure scenarios
- All quality gates pass (ruff, pylint, mypy, shellcheck, pydocstyle)
- Full test suite passes (1086 passed, 6 skipped)

### Key Features
- Thread-safe singleton pattern via BaseRegistry
- Multiple lookup methods for flexibility
- Case-insensitive name lookups
- UUID validation and conversion
- Synthetic ID generation for YAML entries without 'id' field
- Name normalization for ID generation (handles special characters, spaces, etc.)
- Comprehensive error handling for malformed YAML entries
- Integration with existing registry exports

### Data Structure
Based on `bluetooth_sig/assigned_numbers/uuids/sdo_uuids.yaml`:
- uuid: The UUID value (like 0xFFFE)
- name: Descriptive name (like "Wireless Power Transfer")
- id: Generated synthetic ID (like "org.bluetooth.sdo.wireless_power_transfer")

### Synthetic ID Generation
- Normalizes names by converting to lowercase and replacing special characters with underscores
- Removes consecutive underscores and trims leading/trailing underscores
- Prefixes with "org.bluetooth.sdo." to create valid identifiers
- Examples:
  - "Wireless Power Transfer" → "org.bluetooth.sdo.wireless_power_transfer"
  - "Car Connectivity Consortium, LLC" → "org.bluetooth.sdo.car_connectivity_consortium_llc"
  - "FiRa Consortium" → "org.bluetooth.sdo.fira_consortium"

### Files Modified
- `src/bluetooth_sig/registry/sdo_uuids.py` - Complete implementation
- `src/bluetooth_sig/registry/__init__.py` - Added sdo_uuids_registry export
- `tests/test_sdo_uuids_registry.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `SIG_YAML_COVERAGE_AUDIT.md` - Updated to mark SDO UUIDs as implemented

### Quality Assurance
- ✅ All tests pass (12/12 for SDO UUIDs, 1086/1086 overall)
- ✅ All linting checks pass
- ✅ Type safety verified
- ✅ No code duplication (inherits from BaseRegistry)
- ✅ Follows established patterns and conventions
- ✅ Synthetic ID generation tested thoroughly

### Progress Update
- **Completed**: 6/7 categories (86% complete)
- **Remaining**: Declarations Registry (low priority)
- **Next Priority**: Declarations Registry

### Implementation Pattern Confirmed
- BaseRegistry[T] generic class for shared singleton/thread-safety
- {Category}Info dataclass with uuid/name/id fields (synthetic ID generation when needed)
- {Category}Registry class with multiple lookup methods
- YAML loading from bluetooth_sig/assigned_numbers/uuids/{category}.yaml
- Comprehensive test suites (success + failure cases)
- Integration through registry/__init__.py exports
