# T52 Environmental Sensor Connection Report

## Device Information
- **Name**: T52-9FB79419
- **MAC Address**: F6:51:E1:61:32:B1
- **Type**: Environmental Sensor (Gas/Air Quality Monitor)
- **Signal Strength**: -63 to -72 dBm (Good)
- **Status**: Discoverable ‚úÖ | Connectable via nRF Connect ‚úÖ | Connectable via Bleak ‚ùå

## Advertised Services
The T52 device advertises three standard BLE services:

1. **Battery Service** (`0000180f-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`)
   - Battery level monitoring
   - Standard BLE service

2. **Device Information Service** (`0000180a-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`)
   - Device manufacturer, model, firmware version
   - Standard BLE service

3. **Environmental Sensing Service** (`0000181a-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`) üéØ
   - **PERFECT MATCH** for our gas sensor framework!
   - This service can contain characteristics for:
     - Temperature, Humidity, Pressure
     - CO2, TVOC, PM1/2.5/10
     - NO2, Ozone, SO2, Ammonia, Methane
     - All characteristics we've implemented!

## Connection Issue Analysis

### Problem
The device is discoverable and advertising properly, but **Bleak/BlueZ fails during automatic service discovery** that occurs during connection establishment.

### Root Cause
- Linux BlueZ stack has compatibility issues with some BLE devices
- Bleak automatically attempts service discovery during connection
- T52 device may require specific timing or connection parameters
- nRF Connect uses different connection strategies that work around these issues

### Evidence
1. Device is actively advertising (confirmed multiple times)
2. nRF Connect successfully connects (confirmed by user)
3. Bleak consistently times out during service discovery phase
4. Error occurs in BlueZ `_wait_for_services_discovery()` function

## Alternative Connection Strategies

### 1. Use nRF Connect for Service Discovery
Since nRF Connect works, you can use it to:
1. Connect to the T52 device
2. Document all services and characteristics
3. Note the UUIDs and data formats
4. Test reading values for different characteristics

### 2. Try Different BLE Libraries
Alternative Python BLE libraries that might work better:
- **bluepy** (different BlueZ interface)
- **pybluez** (different approach)
- **BLE-GATT** (alternative implementation)

### 3. Use gatttool Command Line
```bash
# Connect using gatttool
gatttool -I -b F6:51:E1:61:32:B1

# In gatttool interactive mode:
connect
primary        # List services
char-desc      # List characteristics
char-read-hnd 0x0010  # Read specific characteristic
```

### 4. Bluetooth HCI Debug
Enable detailed Bluetooth logging:
```bash
# Enable HCI logging
sudo btmon

# Try connection in another terminal
# Monitor the HCI traffic to see where it fails
```

## Framework Integration Opportunity

The T52 device's **Environmental Sensing Service** is exactly what our gas sensor framework is designed for! Once connected, we should be able to:

1. **Validate our implementation** against real hardware
2. **Test all our gas sensor characteristics**:
   - CO2 (`2BD0`)
   - TVOC (`2BD1`)
   - PM1/2.5/10 characteristics
   - Temperature, Humidity, Pressure
3. **Verify data parsing** with real sensor values
4. **Test our framework's automatic characteristic discovery**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Use nRF Connect** to explore the T52 device services and characteristics
2. **Document the characteristic UUIDs** you find
3. **Note the data formats** of readings
4. **Test which characteristics are readable/writable**

### For Framework Development
1. **Compare discovered characteristics** with our implemented ones
2. **Validate our UUID registry** against real device
3. **Test data parsing** with actual sensor values
4. **Identify any missing characteristics** we should implement

### Connection Workarounds
1. Try connection on **different devices** (Android phone with Python, Windows PC)
2. Use **nRF Connect** as the primary tool for now
3. Consider **implementing a nRF Connect bridge** if needed
4. Try **alternative BLE libraries** if Bleak continues to fail

## Next Steps

1. **Explore T52 with nRF Connect** - document all services/characteristics
2. **Compare with our framework** - see what matches
3. **Try alternative connection methods** - gatttool, bluepy, etc.
4. **Consider T52 as test device** for our gas sensor framework once connected

The T52 device appears to be an excellent validation target for our gas sensor framework - it's exactly the type of environmental sensing device our framework is designed to support!
