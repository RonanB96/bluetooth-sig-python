#### Implementation Checklist:
- [ ] Create individual characteristic files for each sensor type
- [ ] Implement proper data parsing with correct units
- [ ] Add characteristics to Environmental Sensing Service
- [ ] Create comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Update characteristic registry with new types
- [ ] Validate UUID resolution and name parsing
- [ ] Test with real device data where possible

#### File Structure:
```
src/ble_gatt_device/gatt/characteristics/
â”œâ”€â”€ sensors/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ light.py               # IlluminanceCharacteristic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sound.py               # SoundLevelCharacteristic  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ wind.py                # Wind direction/speed characteristics
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ air_quality.py         # Gas concentration characteristics
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ magnetic.py            # Magnetic field characteristics
```

### 2. Add Major Services
**Priority: Medium** | **Status: Planned**

Expand service coverage beyond the current 4 services:

#### Services to Implement:
- **Health Thermometer Service (0x1809)** - Medical temperature readings
- **Heart Rate Service (0x180D)** - Pulse and heart rate monitoring  
- **Blood Pressure Service (0x1810)** - Blood pressure measurements
- **Glucose Service (0x1808)** - Blood glucose monitoring
- **Cycling Power Service (0x1818)** - Bicycle power meter data
- **Running Speed and Cadence (0x1814)** - Running metrics
- **Location and Navigation Service (0x1819)** - GPS and navigation data

### 3. Convert Scripts to Pytest  
**Priority: Medium** | **Status: Planned**

Improve test coverage and CI integration:

- [ ] Convert `scripts/test_*.py` to proper pytest test cases
- [ ] Add integration tests for real device connections  
- [ ] Create mock device testing framework
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking tests
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline

### 4. Home Assistant Architecture
**Priority: Low** | **Status: Planned**

Clean separation between GATT and HA integration layers:

- [ ] Create HA translation layer (`src/ble_gatt_device/homeassistant/`)
- [ ] Implement device class mappings for HA entities
- [ ] Add state class and device class properties
- [ ] Create HA custom component structure
- [ ] Add configuration flow for device discovery

## Implementation Guidelines

### Sensor Characteristic Pattern
Each sensor characteristic should follow this pattern:

```python
@dataclass
class ExampleSensorCharacteristic(BaseCharacteristic):
    """Example sensor measurement characteristic."""
    
    _characteristic_name: str = "Example Sensor"
    
    def __post_init__(self):
        """Initialize with specific value type and unit."""
        self.value_type = "float"  # or int, string, boolean, bytes
        super().__post_init__()
    
    def parse_value(self, data: bytearray) -> float:
        """Parse sensor data according to Bluetooth SIG specification."""
        if len(data) < 2:
            raise ValueError("Sensor data must be at least 2 bytes")
        
        # Implement parsing according to spec
        raw_value = int.from_bytes(data[:2], byteorder="little", signed=False)
        return raw_value * 0.01  # Apply scaling factor
    
    @property 
    def unit(self) -> str:
        """Get the unit of measurement."""
        return "unit"  # e.g., "lux", "dBA", "Â°", "m/s", "Î¼g/mÂ³"
```

### Testing Requirements
- All characteristics must pass UUID resolution tests
- Parsing functions must handle edge cases (empty data, malformed data)
- Integration tests should validate against real device patterns
- Performance tests for parsing large datasets

### Documentation Standards
- Each characteristic needs comprehensive docstring
- Include reference to Bluetooth SIG specification
- Document data format and scaling factors
- Provide example usage in device integration
