# Documentation Guidelines

## Code Samples

- Every code block must be runnable and validated
- Use Sphinx cross-references: `:class:`BluetoothSIGTranslator``, `:meth:`parse_characteristic``
- Pair code with expected output

## Architecture Diagrams

- Use Mermaid for architecture and flow diagrams in Markdown docs
- Keep diagrams close to the code they describe

## Style

- Google-style docstrings (see python-implementation.instructions.md)
- Task-oriented headings (nouns)
- One-sentence summaries
- Active voice, second-person
- Keep paragraphs under three sentences
